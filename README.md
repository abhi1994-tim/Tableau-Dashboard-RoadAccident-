# Tableau-Dashboard-RoadAccident.
Description:

In this project, I utilized my Tableau software skills to analyze a road accident dataset. I conducted a comprehensive examination of the data, focusing on the nature of the accidents and their distribution across months and years. To visualize the insights, I employed various tools, including bar graphs and matrices.

Conclusion:

Through the data analysis process, I successfully identified the primary causes of road accidents. This investigation allowed me to gain a deep understanding of accident behavior, shedding light on important patterns and trends. By leveraging Tableau's capabilities, I was able to present these findings effectively, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and potential preventive measures in road safety.
